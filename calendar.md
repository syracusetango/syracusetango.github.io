We organize a weekly, free-of charge practica at the Skybarn, South Campus in Syracuse (no partner needed), each Wednesday from 7:30pm to 10:30pm.

We also hold a wonderful milonga, the Milonga Sentimental each month that attracts dancers from all over Central New York. Great food, conversation, and music all in a charming candlelit atmosphere.
