We organize a weekly, free-of charge practica at the Skybarn (151 Farm Acre Rd, Syracuse, NY) on the South Campus of Syracuse University (no partner needed), each Tuesday from 7:30pm to 10:00pm. 

We also hold a wonderful milonga, the Milonga Sentimental each month that attracts dancers from all over Central New York. Great food, conversation, and music all in a charming candlelit atmosphere (dates TBA).
