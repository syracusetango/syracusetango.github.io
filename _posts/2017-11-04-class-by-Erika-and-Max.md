Come and join us for our practica on November 15, when Erika and Max will teach us something about musicality, the walk, and the embrace. 
It's just $10. To sign up, just follow <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu27Kfpy6I3_uBqC7rLM3nxfcmeAvoz45wAQrVIEeqo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this link</a>.

> In this class, we will be teaching you how to incorporate musicality into your movement through simple tango moves and creative exercises. Along with these skills, we'll be focusing on how to bring your walk and your connection in the embrace to the next level through both musicality and some new steps. Our goal is to give you usable vocabulary, steps, and figures to help you apply what you're learning directly, not just theoretically. This class will be 1.5 hours long with a 10 min break. 

**We do need at least 10 people to sign up and commit to attending!**  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uu27Kfpy6I3_uBqC7rLM3nxfcmeAvoz45wAQrVIEeqo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">You can sign up here.</a>
